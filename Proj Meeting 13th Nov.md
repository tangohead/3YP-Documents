# Comments
* Fill in tree/refs etc - by end of today, add refs where possible  (do links) for sending down to SandTable

* Present reconfiguration differently.
* Change 'tie to outside world' sentence, needs to be understandable rather than meaningless 
* Informed by linear threshold
* include attributes
* Sampled networks should be used in final stage as well as development.
